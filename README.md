# big-man-betweenness
This repository contains all working material pertinent to the Big Man Betweenness [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/brunoscodari/big-man-betweenness-bmb), which was submitted to the NFL Big Data Bowl 2023 Kaggle competition. 

## Environment
The `R` programming language was used in our analytical workflow. The exact version and packages used are detailed in `requirements.txt`. 

## Reproducibility
Cloning the repository and navigating to the root of the working directory is recommended for anybody who seeks to reproduce this work. To do so, please run the following Bash commands: 
```
git clone https://github.com/bscod27/big-man-betweenness.git
cd big-man-betweenness.git
``` 
## Scripts
The following scripts were used in this project and executed in chronological order: 
1. `tracking.R` - converts the weekly tracking data from `.csv >> .gz` to compress the data into a form that can be pushed to GitHub; note that this script assumes the tracking data has been downloaded locally as `.csv` files
2. `batch_build.R` - command-line implementation that intakes the raw data, constructs frame-by-frame networks for each play, calculates network measures of interest, and creates weekly builds for downstream analysis 
3. `analysis.R` - takes the builds, wrangles them into analysis-friendly form, and produces the results found in the [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/brunoscodari/big-man-betweenness-bmb)
4. `gifs.R` - saves down the individual images for the network GIFs

## Folders
Data, visuals, and other pertinent material are partitioned inside the following folders:
- `data` - contains the raw data as supplied by Kaggle; weekly tracking data has been converted to `.gz` files by `tracking.R`
- `builds` - contains the engineered data produced by `builds.R`
- `images` - contains all images produced produced by `analysis.R` 
- `gifs` - contains all GIFs produced by `gifs.R` and `analysis.R`
- `snippets` - contains intermediate data generated by `analysis.R`
