#### Please note the following:
- `betw` and `pos` contain the individual screenshots for the images that compose `betw_anim.gif` and `pos_anim.gif`, which were generated by the `gifs.R` script; EZGIF's [GIF Maker](https://ezgif.com/maker) application was used to generate the GIFs in the notebook
- `ggplot2_anim.gif` was generated by the `analysis.R` script
- `plotly_anim` was generated by the following steps: running `plotly_viz.py` (creates `plotly_html.html`), using a video editor to capture the animation as an MP4, and converting the MP4 to a GIF via EZGIF's [Video to GIF](https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif) application; the script uses `Python 3` and the following packages: 
  - `plotly` - 5.11.0
  - `pandas` - 1.3.4
  - `matplotlib` - 3.4.3
