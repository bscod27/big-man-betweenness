Please note the following:
- `betw` and `pos` contain the individual screenshots for the images that compose `betw_anim.gif` and `pos_anim.gif`, which were generated by the `gifs.R`script; [Animated GIF Maker](https://ezgif.com/maker) was used to generate the GIFs in the notebook
- `ggplot2_anim.gif` was generated by the `analysis.R` script
- `plotly_anim` was generated by the following steps: running `plotly_viz.py`, using a video editor to capture the animation as a video, and converting the MP4 manually to a GIF; it was created to provide a Python alternative to `ggplot2_anim.gif` but is less reproducible
