#### Please note the following:
- `pos_anim.gif` and `betw_anim.gif` were generated by the `gifs.R` script
- `ggplot2_anim.gif` was generated by the `analysis.R` script
- `plotly_anim` was generated by the following steps: running `analysis.R` (to create input data) then `plotly_viz.py` (to create an HTML), using a video editor to capture the HTML as an MP4, and converting the MP4 to a GIF via EZGIF's [Video to GIF](https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif) application; the script uses `Python 3` and the following packages: 
  - `plotly` - 5.11.0
  - `pandas` - 1.3.4
  - `matplotlib` - 3.4.3
