# big-man-betweenness
This repository contains all working material pertinent to the Big Man Betweenness [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/brunoscodari/big-man-betweenness-bmb), which was submitted to the NFL Big Data Bowl 2023 [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2023). 

## Reproducibility
For those seeking to reproduce our work, we recommend the following: 
- Install the specific version of `R` and required packages outlined in `requirements.txt`
- Clone a remote copy of the repository to your local machine and navigate to the root directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/bscod27/big-man-betweenness.git
cd big-man-betweenness.git
``` 

- Download, unzip, and store the competition [files](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2023/data) in the `data` folder
- Execute the scripts detailed below

## Scripts
The following scripts were used in this project and executed in chronological order: 
1. `batch_build.R` - command-line implementation that intakes the raw data, constructs frame-by-frame networks for each play, calculates network measures of interest, and creates weekly builds for downstream analysis 
2. `analysis.R` - takes the builds, wrangles them into analysis-friendly form, and produces the results
3. `gifs.R` - saves down the individual images for the network GIFs

## Folders
Data, visuals, and other pertinent material are partitioned inside the following folders:
- `data` - placeholder folder for the competition data
- `builds` - contains the weekly builds produced by `batch_build.R` and the play-level dataset shown in the report, which was produced by `analysis.R`
- `images` - contains the images produced by `analysis.R`
- `gifs` - contains the animations produced by `gifs.R` and `analysis.R`; it also contains a supplementary animation generated by a `Python` approach, whose details are documented in `gifs`

## Acknowledgements
We want to recognize the following individuals for their support throughout this project: Dr. Jiang Gui, Courtney Schiebout, George Price, and Aidan Cook. We would also like to thank Dartmouth's Information, Technology and Consulting team for providing the computational resources needed to carry out this work.
