# big-man-betweenness
This repository contains all working material pertinent to the Big Man Betweenness [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/brunoscodari/big-man-betweenness-bmb), which was submitted to the NFL Big Data Bowl 2023 Kaggle competition. 

## Environment
The `R` programming language was used in our analytical workflow. The exact version and packages used are detailed in `requirements.txt`. 

## Working Directory
To clone the working directory, please run the following Bash commands: 
```
https://github.com/bscod27/big-man-betweenness.git
git clone ssh://john@example.com/path/to/my-project.git 
cd my-project
``` 


## Scripts
The scripts employed are detailed below: 
- `tracking.R` - pulls the weekly tracking data and converts the files from `.csv >> .gz` to compress the data into a form that can be pushed to GitHub
- `batch_build.R` - command-line implementation that intakes the raw data, constructs frame-by-frame networks for each play, calculates network measures of interest, and creates weekly builds for downstream analysis 
- `analysis.R` - takes the builds, wrangles them into analysis-friendly form, and produces the results found in the [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/brunoscodari/big-man-betweenness-bmb)
- `gifs.R` - saves down the individual images for the network GIFs

## Folders
Data, visuals, and other pertinent material are partitioned inside the following folders:
- `data` - contains the raw data as supplied by Kaggle; weekly tracking data has been converted to `.gz` files by `tracking.R`
- `builds` - contains the engineered data produced by `builds.R`
- `images` - contains all images produced produced by `analysis.R` 
- `gifs` - contains all GIFs produced by `gifs.R` and `analysis.R`
- `snippets` - contains intermediate data generated by `analysis.R`
