# Data
This is a placeholder folder for all project data, including the following files: 
- [Competition Data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2023/data) (must pull and store locally)
  - `games.csv`
  - `pffScoutingData.csv`
  - `players.csv`
  - `plays.csv`
  - `week<#>.csv`
- Weekly "builds" (generated by `batch_build.R`)
  - `build<#>.csv`
- Miscellaneous data (generated by `analysis.R`)
  - `plotly_stats.csv`

We have not stored the above files in this folder, as the competition [rules](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2023/rules) prohibit public redistribution of the data.

This folder also contains two subfolders, which contain the images comprising the `igraph` network animations:
- `pos`
- `betw`
