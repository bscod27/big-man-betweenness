# Data
This is a placeholder folder for the competition [data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2023/data), which should be pulled and stored locally. Those files are as follows: 
- `games.csv`
- `pffScoutingData.csv`
- `players.csv`
- `plays.csv`
- `week1.csv`
- `week2.csv`
- `week3.csv`
- `week4.csv`
- `week5.csv`
- `week6.csv`
- `week7.csv`
- `week8.csv`

We have not stored the above files in this folder, as the competition [rules](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2023/rules) prohibit public redistribution of the data.
